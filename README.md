# ACIM-MC_PILOT_GUI

GUI configuration for [X-CUBE-MCSDK](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-mcsdk.html) Motor Pilot for ACIM tuning based on FOC (added float LSO tuning parameters and HF regsiters for speed and angle).

For using such it is needed to patch ACIM project as [MEZ-ACIM-FOC](https://github.com/novaksta/MEZ-ACIM-FOC) -- see registes and scales struct fix.
